## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2019 is recommended, Veloce is currently not supported on platforms other than Windows.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/roberttully95/Veloce`.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.
